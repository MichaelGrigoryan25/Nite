# Nite 📝

Nite is an open-source note-taking app for Android based systems.

The word Nite is actually a mix of two words: <b>Note</b> and <b>Night</b>.



## Getting Started 📂

- Make sure you have <b>Android Studio</b> or <b>IntelliJ</b> installed. <b>Visual Studio Code</b> will work too if you have the required extensions.
- Open either of them and run the app by clicking on the green button located on the top right corner of your screen(when using Android Studio/IntelliJ) on an emulator or a physical device and that should be it!
