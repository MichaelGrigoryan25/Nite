## Getting Started üìÇ

- Make sure you have **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ** installed. **Visual Studio Code** will work too if you have the required extensions.
- Open either of them and run the app by clicking on the green button located on the top right corner of your screen(when using Android Studio/IntelliJ) on an emulator or a physical device and that should be it!
